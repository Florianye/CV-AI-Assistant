*** Education ***
- Between September 2010 and June 2014, I was in secondary school and successfully graduated from the GRG21 school at Franklinstraße 21, 1210 Vienna.
- Between September 2014 and June 2019, I attended and successfully graduated from the Vienna Business School at Franklinstraße 24, 1210 Vienna. I specialized in the field of finance and risk management. In addition to the compulsory subjects, I also completed my Matura in business informatics, which I passed with an excellent grade.
- I obtained my bachelor's degree at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, at Welthandelsplatz 1. I studied Business Informatics and specialized in "Data Science" (grade: 1) and "Business Information Systems" (grade: 1). I studied between September 2020 and April 2023 and graduated with an average grade of 1.5. I received a merit scholarship in the academic year 2020/21 and 2021/22 and was on the WU Rector's List in the summer term 2022.
My bachelors thesis is called “Comparison of community detection algorithms using LFR benchmarking”, where I received a grade 1.
Abstract of my bachelor thesis: “Polarization can occur in various areas of society and is further intensified by social media. Therefore, in this bachelor thesis, based on Twitter data, the topics of the US elections in 2020 between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the vaccination debate sharpened by COVID-19, and the Ukraine war that started in February 2022 are examined in more detail. Various community detection algorithms are performed and compared using the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark to determine which technique best suits real- world networks. In the process, diverse communities are identified, and some of the largest ones are subsequently analyzed. The results reveal the communities with their respective positive and negative emotion scores and their most frequent hashtags. From this, it can be interpreted that US elections and vaccine networks demonstrate tendencies towards user polarization, which is not the case with the Ukraine war. Overall, this work provides a first glimpse into the complex social networks and identifies different viewpoints of Twitter users.”
Conclusion of my bachelor thesis: “In numerous published papers, the polarization of users on social platforms such as Twitter has been demonstrated and is growing over time, especially on controversial issues. This thesis aims to compare various community detection techniques, which are an essential application factor for identifying polarization. Label propagation, Louvain, and InfoMap algorithms were compared practically using LFR benchmarking. Subsequently, the implementation was performed on three separate real-world networks based on user tweets regarding the US elections between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in 2020, the vaccine issue during COVID-19, and the Ukraine war caused by the invasion of Russia in 2022. The algorithms were found to be reasonably fast in the benchmark comparison, taking only a few minutes to execute on networks between 200,000 and 450,000 nodes. It has been shown that the μ value of the networks is an influential parameter in the application of community detection algorithms. Furthermore, due to the high normalized mutual information score, applying the Louvain algorithm to the three actual real-world networks was decided. The comparison of various measures, such as conductance, modularity, and cut ratio, showed no significant differences.
In applying these techniques, identifying the communities revealed tendencies towards polarization in the US elections and the vaccine debate. In the US elections, groups belonging to the Republican and Democratic parties emerged. The identified communities on the vaccine issue showed many sup- porters of vaccination in general and users expressing themselves negatively against Donald Trump. One group was identified, which is more concerned with conspiracy theories derived from specific hashtags regarding vaccination’s greater purpose than protecting against the virus. On the other hand, the Ukraine war network showed substantial overlaps among the communities due to the support for Ukraine and negativity against Russia, indicating that no polarization can be interpreted here. Furthermore, when looking at the average sentiment scores of the communities, it is apparent that tweets about US elections and vaccines are primarily positive in emotions, while tweets about the Ukraine war are more mixed with positives and negatives.
There were some noteworthy limitations in this work. In benchmarking, for example, fixed parameters for degree distribution and community size distribution were set for all three LFR graphs instead of being determined precisely for the networks. More extensive questions could be answered on this topic for future work, and more in-depth work could be pursued. Some extensive topics include analyzing the tweets’ texts in more detail through natural language processing and considering data over a more considerable time, including timestamps of the tweets.
Overall, the work demonstrates substantial insight into the performance of various community detection algorithms and the complex structures of the resulting networks. Thus, essential conclusions on user polarization were drawn, making the thesis a foundation for future work.”

Course 1: Here we mainly used Python.
Course 2: Here we mainly used R programming language
Course 3: Here we mainly used Python. In a group of 4 we worked on our final project about Spotify.
Motivation for picking this project: “We decided to pick Spotify as the topic of our project since all of our group members are avid listeners of good music and use Spotify on a daily basis. Therefore, it did not take long to come up with this idea. We then further brainstormed which aspect would be worth exploring more in detail – after all, selected user data, artists, songs, and playlists were all available to us through the custom Spotify API. Too many datapoints to analyse in the span of one project. However, after looking at the local and worldwide charts, it became quite apparent to us that one aspect of today’s music interests us the most – many popular songs sound pretty similar to each other. Why is that? Are there certain characteristics which all popular songs possess? If so, could we train an algorithm to detect whether or not a given song is predicted to become popular based on these characteristics? Of course, there probably exist several hundred variables which determine the popularity of a song. However, we only have access to some of them – specifically the ones available via the Spotify API. As such, our goal for this project is to answer the question whether we can accurately predict if a given song is popular or not based a variety of descriptive variables provided by the Spotify API.”
Conclusion of our project: “We were particularly quick to come up with the idea of using Spotify as our project theme and put a lot of time into thinking about how we would approach it and what exactly we would do. Even though we initially wanted to get our data from ‘Kaggle’, difficulties arose quickly when we read Spotify’s terms. After thorough research of the 'Spotify Developer Terms' and 'Spotify Developer Policy', we concluded to get the data from Spotify's API ourselves instead of utilizing an already pre-compiled dataset. Regarding 'Private Data', in our case there were not so many ethical as well as legal concerns. Nevertheless, we carefully examined the issue and came to the conclusion that the majority of internet users do not really pay attention to what personal data they leave behind or accept cookies arbitrarily. The main reason for this is mostly laziness to read the privacy policies or to actively deal with their own data protection in general. Furthermore, during our research we realized that biases could occur at all stages of our activity, such as e.g., collecting and importing data, cleaning data, data visualization or data analysis. After finally obtaining our data from Spotify's API and storing it in a CSV file, we moved on to the preparation for our data analysis afterwards. Immediately before building some models, we looked at the data in more detail through some visualizations. This allowed us to see, for example, the distribution of popular and unpopular songs, and to view some correlations plots between specific parameters and the popularity scores. For the machine learning part, we decided on a total of four models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine) for better comparison and came to the final conclusion that the Random Forest model performed as the best prediction model in our case.”
Course 4: We mainly used R programming language here. In a group of 4 we worked on our 2 projects regarding marketing.
Project 1 Introduction:  “The goal of this project was to build different models which helps with the decision which customers to target in order to prevent customer churns. A dataset with customer of an online retailer is given. With the given dataset a logistic regression and a decision tree was conducted.”
Project 2 Introduction: “For our data source for this project we scrape Amazon reviews of the Apple MacBook Air M1. Our goal is to build a code that analyzes the text in order to give insights in customers interests for the product, product improvements and relevant topics which often occur. Which then should help the producer to improve the product experience to score good on the product rating. Therefore the last part of the project consists recommendations for action which the brand should consider.”
Course 5: We mainly used Python here. In a group of 4 we worked in our final project in cooperation with Dolphin Technologies GmbH on a data science problem.
Project introduction: “Dolphin Technologies GmbH, a business focused on providing telematic services to international companies, was founded in Austria in 2001. By working in cooperation with various industry partners as well as by utilizing their own mobile apps, Dolphin has been able to gather and analyse a variety of user data over the years, leading to vast experience in the field of GPS data, sensor data, and time-series data. This makes Dolphin especially valuable for insurance companies, for example by providing software solutions which are able to effectively predict the number of accidents for specific clients, as well as which features are the best predictors for an accident. 
Since staff at Dolphin is always concerned with enhancing their current machine learning models and therefore boosting accuracy, the company teamed up with Data Science students at WU in order to improve the quality of one of their classification models for differentiating be- tween individual modes of transport. The contents of the following project will exclusively be concerned with data extracted from Dolphin’s own mobile app Mobilio. Utilizing this GPS and sensor data, a machine learning model shall be trained which is able to distinguish between five different forms of transport.“
Project Goals: „Differentiating between ’driving’, ’cycling’, and ’train’ works reasonably well. However, the classification process does not perform as well for ’metro’, and ’tram’.  Two main goals exist for this project. First of all, the classes are not distributed evenly. Nearly six times as many people in the data set were taking a trip with their car rather than taking the metro or tram. In order to enlarge this data set and balance out the given class distribution, our team will be researching and implementing methods of Synthetic Data Augmentation to see if model results can be improved upon. 
As a logical next step, our second main goal for this project will involve trying to improve the current classification benchmarks by trying out various approaches. Furthermore, the finished paper as well as the source code shall be documented in a clear and concise manner and touch upon the encountered issues so that staff at Dolphin will be able to continue our work and improve upon it. 
Project Conclusion: „As mentioned in the beginning, two main goals were of essence for this project: 1.) test out if data augmentation methods are able to increase classification results of a base model, and 2.) try to improve the classification results compared to a benchmark. The classes to be identified include ’driving’, ’cycling’, ’tram’, ’metro’, and ’train’, where the latter three can also be condensed to a ’public transport’ class, which is depicted in some ROC curves. The reason for experimenting with synthetic data was the imbalance in observations among the analysed classes, with ’driving’ having about five to six times the amount of observations compared to the minority classes ’metro’ and ’tram’. 
In order to tackle these goals we tried out several approaches: Feature Selection, Standardization, Normalization, Data Augmentation with Conditional Tabular Generative Adverserial Networks (CTGAN), Tabular Variational Auto Encoder (TVAE), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and Copula, testing out different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), predicting with a binary then multiclass model, tuning model hyperparameters, and manually adjusting probability thresholds of the predicted classes. 
It turned out that not all of these approaches achieved satisfying results. Neither standardizing nor normalizing our tabular dataset improved results in any significant way but rather decreased them considerably. Likewise, machine learning models other than XGBoost and the binary then multiclass approach were of no use. To add to this, unfortunately the data augmentation approach did not prove to be viable as well. Even though for different data creation methods were tested out and compared with each other, none of them improved the results of our baseline.
However, we were able to improve classification results very slightly by adjusting the hyperparameters of our XGBoost base model. Furthermore, the kind of features has been re-evaluated and their amount has been reduced, all while achieving decent predictability in com- parison to a model utilizing the features of the entire dataset. Lastly, what did indeed prove useful were the manual adjustments of probability thresholds for the finished XGBoost model.
All in all, the following benefits for Dolphin could be generated: 
1.	Due to our experimentation with data augmentation methods it is no longer necessary for staff at Dolphin to occupy themselves with this topic. 
2.	We reduced the original feature set, with which consistent classification are possible. By reducing the amount of features Dolphin is able to work more efficiently and save costs by reducing unnecessary computation time. 
3.	Simultaneously, we were also able to improve overall classification results for the minority classes. With this, Dolphin can provide better services to its customers.
